### Patterns

`std::endl` flushes the output buffer which can be costly for large texts, so `\n` is best.  

`bits/stdc++.h` contains all standard libs.  

Optimize loops using break and continue.  

Most online coding platforms run __~10^8 op/sec__.

## Pattern printing problems:
1. ## Be careful with indices and comparison operators (off by one error.) ##

2. Develop solution in stages:  
* incomplete naive - just get some output  
* complete naive - complete naive output  
* optimize - performance and / or readibility
