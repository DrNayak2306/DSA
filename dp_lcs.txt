longest common substring

top down memoization
comparison setup:
pointer i on string 1 (right to left)
pointer j on string 2 (right to left)

if match:
	return 1 + left shift both by one and recursively compute
if not match:
	return 0 + max(left shift pointer i and recursively compute,
					left shift pointer j and recursively compute)

time: O(mn)
space: O(mn) + O(m+n) [stack space]
